    "## Predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using the \"mammographic masses\" public dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data contains 961 instances of masses detected in mammograms, and contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. BI-RADS assessment: 1 to 5 (ordinal)  \n",
    "   2. Age: patient's age in years (integer)\n",
    "   3. Shape: mass shape: round=1 oval=2 lobular=3 irregular=4 (nominal)\n",
    "   4. Margin: mass margin: circumscribed=1 microlobulated=2 obscured=3 ill-defined=4 spiculated=5 (nominal)\n",
    "   5. Density: mass density high=1 iso=2 low=3 fat-containing=4 (ordinal)\n",
    "   6. Severity: benign=0 or malignant=1 (binominal)\n",
    "   \n",
    "BI-RADS is an assesment of how confident the severity classification is; it is not a \"predictive\" attribute and so we will discard it. The age, shape, margin, and density attributes are the features that we will build our model with, and \"severity\" is the classification we will attempt to predict based on those attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although \"shape\" and \"margin\" are nominal data types, which sklearn typically doesn't deal with well, they are close enough to ordinal that we shouldn't just discard them. The \"shape\" for example is ordered increasingly from round to irregular.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of unnecessary anguish and surgery arises from false positives arising from mammogram results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Build a better way to interpret them through supervised machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Your assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply Artificial Neural Network supervised machine learning techniques to this data set and validate it by applying K-Fold cross validation (K=10).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data needs to be cleaned; many rows contain missing data, and there may be erroneous data identifiable as outliers as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many optimization techniques provide the means of \"hyperparameters\" to be tuned (e.g. Genetic Algorithms). Once you identify a promising approach, see if you can make it even better by tuning its hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below it's described the set of steps that outline the development of this project, with some guidance and hints. If you're up for a real challenge, try doing this project from scratch in a new, clean notebook!\n"
